SMTP 101
********


Overview
========
SMTP (Simple Message Transport Protocol) is the underlying protocol used by e-mail messaging. Originally defined in RFC821 and updated in 2008 by RFC5321 to include ESMTP (extended SMTP), it is one of the most commonly used, and first encountered, protocols for operations engineers.

In this course, we will cover an introduction to SMTP, the basics of an SMTP conversation and the composite parts, and some commonly used SMTP software components.

The SMTP Conversation
=====================

SMTP conversations generally happen between both MUAs ("Mail User Agent") and MTAs ("Mail Transport Agents"), and between MTAs themselves.
