HTTP 101 (Core protocol)
************************

In this course, we're going to cover the background of HTTP, the semantics of the protocol itself, and some simple uses of it with a range of tools. 

A Brief History of HTTP 
============================================

HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - is the underlying protocol for delivery of documents on the World Wide Web. Most of you are probably reading this using a web browser, which is communicating with a webserver over HTTP. It is an asynchronous, distributed protocol used for the interchange of data.

HTTP 1.0 was released in 1996, and was updated and ratified in RFC2616 in 1999. HTTP 1.1 introduced new features in response to the popularity of HTTP 1.0 to allow for functionality such as virtual hosting, persistence of connections and caching to support scalability

A Simple Overview
============================================

In its simplest form, HTTP is a request-response style protocol, where a User-Agent (a web browser, for instance) issues a webserver (Apache, for instance) a request for content using one of several verbs defined in the RFC.    



Verbs
============================================

GET 
HEAD
POST
CONNECT
